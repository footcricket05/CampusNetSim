# CampusNetSim: Smart Campus Simulation Using DHCP with Cisco Packet Tracer üè´üåê

## Overview üìö

Welcome to the CampusNetSim project repository. This repository contains the essential files for the Smart Campus Simulation Project, where we explore the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) technology within a university campus environment. Our project is focused on the utilization of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for efficient IP address allocation, network security, scalability, and resource optimization within the campus network.

## Repository Contents üì¶

1. **Smart Campus (DHCP).pkt:** This Packet Tracer (pkt) file serves as the core of our project. It encompasses the network topology, device configurations, and DHCP settings employed in the Smart Campus Simulation.

2. **Smart Campus (DHCP) Report.pdf:** Our PDF report offers an extensive overview of the Smart Campus Simulation Project. It delves into the project's objectives, the integral role of DHCP, network architecture, and the outcomes. Furthermore, it explores the practical implications of IoT technology within a university campus setting.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To embark on your Smart Campus Simulation journey, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/footcricket05/DHCP-Implementation-IoT
   ```

2. Open the `Smart Campus (DHCP).pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network topology and DHCP configuration central to the project.

3. Dive into the `Smart Campus (DHCP) Report.pdf` for an in-depth understanding of the project's objectives, outcomes, and the significant role played by DHCP within the simulation.

# CampusNetSim: Smart Campus Simulation Using DHCP with Cisco Packet Tracer 🏫🌐

## Overview 📚

Welcome to the CampusNetSim project repository. This repository contains the essential files for the Smart Campus Simulation Project, where we explore the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) technology within a university campus environment. Our project is focused on the utilization of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for efficient IP address allocation, network security, scalability, and resource optimization within the campus network.

**Note**: This repository offers an insightful exploration of IoT technology and the role of DHCP in creating a Smart Campus Simulation. Whether you're a student looking to learn more about networking, IoT, or DHCP, an educator searching for teaching materials, or a network professional interested in campus network optimization, this project provides valuable resources and hands-on experience. Enjoy your journey through the Smart Campus Simulation! 🏫🌐🚀

## Repository Contents 📦

1. **Smart Campus (DHCP).pkt:** This Packet Tracer (pkt) file serves as the core of our project. It encompasses the network topology, device configurations, and DHCP settings employed in the Smart Campus Simulation.

2. **Smart Campus (DHCP) Report.pdf:** Our PDF report offers an extensive overview of the Smart Campus Simulation Project. It delves into the project's objectives, the integral role of DHCP, network architecture, and the outcomes. Furthermore, it explores the practical implications of IoT technology within a university campus setting.
